👋 Hi, I’m @EasonXeu

I’m a software engineer with **8 years of hands-on experience**, having worked at top tech companies including **Alibaba Cloud** and **Huawei**. My core expertise lies in building **high-performance, scalable, and secure systems**, especially in the field of **cloud infrastructure and security**.

### 💼 Engineering Background

At **Alibaba Cloud**, I led and contributed to the design and development of several key authentication systems:

- **AccessKey** – A mission-critical, high-availability authentication system that sustained **3B+ QPS** and served as the **security backbone** of the platform.  
- **Login Center** – Provided centralized login management to all IAM users.
- **CloudSSO** - Provided big companies with seamless SSO experiences across their multiple cloud account. 

These projects gave me deep experience in **distributed architecture**, **fault tolerance**, and **high-availability design**, ensuring **99.99% uptime** under extreme workloads.
